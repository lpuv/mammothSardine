    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p style="color: #A3A3A3">There are conflicting stories about how Mammoth Cave was discovered by non-Natives. According to one story, a man named John Houchins was hunting a black bear close to the cave’s entrance and chased him inside. When he saw the underground expanse, all thoughts of chasing his bear vanished and instead he went a-cavin’. No one knows the exact date this first exploration of the cave system occurred. Some stories say 1798 and some say 1802. Next, a man named Valentine Simons won a land warrant of 200 acres of land on the Green River in a state lottery. That land included two “petre caves”, which are caves that contain nitre, used in the making of gunpowder. Those “petre caves” were, in fact, Mammoth Cave and Dixon Cave, so Simon is considered Mammoth Cave’s first legal owner. </p>
    <p style="color: #A3A3A3">Settlers started coming in the 1800s with land grants given in reward for serving in the Revolutionary War. These settlers were mainly farmers and loggers. A man named Jacob Locke settled atop Flint Ridge, not knowing he had settled above an area called Colossal Cave. The problem was that Mammoth Cave and Colossal Cave were interconnected, and so ownership of those caves were in question. As a result, many lawsuits were filed. Jacob Locke, a Christian, built (or helped to build) most of the Baptist and some Methodist churches in the area. </p>
    <p style="color: #A3A3A3">Mammoth Cave was an important source of nitre, a mineral essential to the making of gunpowder. The term “petre cave” refers to the presence of calcium nitrate, or nitre, inside the cave. Nitre could be converted to saltpeter, which in turn could be changed to gunpowder. Nitre was so important that in 1812, the cave’s worth multiplied 25 times in a single day. Hyman Gratz and Charles Wilkins bought Mammoth Cave in 1812 to start a saltpeter industry underground. They had 70 slaves to change nitre to saltpeter. The slaves created the equipment required to do this. </p>
	  <p style="color: #A3A3A3">They first made wood pipes from tulip poplar logs. Square percolating vats were then built, with split logs overlapping to form a filter below. The slaves placed collection troughs below the vats, and a pump tower that rose in the center of the site. When complete, the apparatus worked like this. First, cave soil was scooped into the vats. Then, water flowed through the wooden pipes to pour over the soil in the vats. The water would seep into the soil, filtering out the nitre. An amber-colored bubbly liquid then poured into the collection troughs, called “nitre beer”. Then, a slave standing on top of the pump would send the “nitre beer” up to the surface. Slaves outside the cave would then mix the nitre liquid with potassium-rich ingredients like potash, oxblood and turnips. Then, they would boil the mixture over an open fire until all the water had evaporated, leaving crystals of saltpeter behind. Finally, they would send the packaged crystals to the newly-formed DuPont chemical factory in Delaware to be changed into gunpowder.</p>

	  <p style="color: #A3A3A3">That was a good thing, because America needed that gunpowder. War was brewing, a war we now call the War of 1812. The United States found itself again at war with the British, and one British strategy was to block off America’s supplies of foreign gunpowder. If not for Mammoth Cave and Dixon Cave (another local cave), the British would probably have won the War of 1812. </p>
	  <p style="color: #A3A3A3">In 1812, people had started paying to visit the caves. Gratz and Wilkins increased their holdings to 1,340 acres — to control all cave entrances. They did this because they could make profit off the visitors. That was the start of Mammoth Cave tourism, now one of the oldest tourist destinations in the world.</p>

	  <p style="color: #A3A3A3">Next, Franklin Gorin bought the cave from Gratz and immediately saw the cave’s potential as a tourist attraction. He hired a slave named Steven Bishop to guide wealthy white tourists into Mammoth Cave. He only owned the cave for a year, and then had to sell it to Dr. John Croghan of Louisville for financial reasons. Dr. Croghan let Bishop explore the cave. In 1838 Bishop crossed an area called the Bottomless Pit with a ladder, opening the cave for further exploration. By 1839 he discovered the Echo and Roaring underground rivers, as well as strange eyeless fish living in those rivers. In 1840, he came upon his greatest discovery: the Mammoth Dome. His discoveries continued until his death, of unknown reasons, in 1857. Dr. Croghan died in 1949, and his will freed Bishop in seven years, or 1856. So, Bishop only had a year of freedom before his death.</p>
